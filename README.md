**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

1. UNRELIABLE DATA

                ‚Ä¢ Due to inaccurate and unreliable data of the covid cases in different parts of India,
                  the various Govt. schemes and policies are not getting their best results. 


2. COVID-19 spread

                ‚Ä¢ India is one of the worst affected countries in the world due to the covid outbreak.
                
                ‚Ä¢ So, in these times implementing effective vaccination policies according to the density of cases is difficult.

**CHALLENGES DEEP DIVE**
1. Collecting Accurate Data

                ‚Ä¢ In times of chaos, collecting data can only be possible by visiting trusted websites by Govt.
                  as following COVID norms physical data collection might be a problem.



2. Joining the various related Attributes


                ‚Ä¢ For better analysing the data we must find the relation between the various attributes related to 
                  COVID spread and join them in the most effective manner.
